Who wants to be a Millionaire?
The hit TV show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" is a game show that uses a basic rule set: answer a multiple choice question correctly, get more money. Your goal is to recreate a shorter version of the game with 8 questions. 

Before the game starts, prompt the user for their name.

Before each round, the game should tell the user how much money they have currently made. Store the amount of money they have made in a variable. Then you should present the question on one line and the four multiple choice options on seperate lines. Prompt the user for the answer with ">>". Your program should look like the following (user input is in bold):

Welcome to Millionaire! What is your name? Daniel

Currently you have made $0.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest summit on which continent?

a. Asia

b. Africa

c. Europe

d. Australia

>> b

Correct!

Currently you have made $500.

Which NBA team has won the most championships?

a. Boston Celtics

b. Los Angeles Lakers

c. Golden State Warriors

d. Chicago Bulls

>> a

Correct!

Currently you have made $1000.

Which Drake album came out first chronologically?

a. Thank Me Later

b. Scorpion

c. Views

d. Nothing was the Same

>> b

I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

 

You can make up the questions to be on any topic(s) you want, but there should be eight in total. A user can only go to the next question if they get all previous questions right. As soon as they get a question wrong, the game should end and they should be told how much money they won.

If a user does get all eight questions correct, you should congratulate the user and tell them "You are a millionaire!".

Lost in the Capitol

Your friends in the Computer Science department have been complaining to you that DC is confusing to get around. Due to the high cost of their mobile plan's data rates, they can’t use map programs like Apple Maps or Google Maps. They've asked you to build a program that tells users where in DC they are compared to some landmarks that they know. Your task is to build a program which tells user's their relative location to some set places. You should:

Ask the user to input their latitude and longitude.
Tell the user if they are North of K St. or South of it.
If they are North of the White House print “You are north of the White House”. If they are south of the white house print “You are south of the White House”. If they are neither, don’t print anything.
If they are west of the White House print “You are west of the White House”. If they are east of the white house print “You are east of the White House”. If they are neither, don’t print anything.
Do the same thing with Downing Hall, Dupont Circle, and Union Station


Use the table below as reference:

Place

Latitude, Longitude

K St (Runs east to west):   38.902649

The White House:    38.897789, -77.036562

Downing Hall:   38.921669, -77.021361

Dupont Circle:    38.909760, -77.043479

Union Station:    38.897698, -77.007200
